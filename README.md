## Results
In the past decade especially, Mental health and its importance has become more talked about and understood.
We wanted to create an app that helps the everyday user clear their conscience and improve their mental health.
We incorporated features such as yoga, calming meditation music, a daily diary that details the users day, positive quotes on each page, and a weekly log that tracks the user’s emotions.
The user can take a few minutes out of their day to relax themselves and focus on the health of their mind.
